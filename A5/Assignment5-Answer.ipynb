Here are some additional suggestions:\n","\n","1. Cross-Validation: Make sure to use cross-validation during the model selection and hyperparameter tuning process. This will help ensure that your model&#x27;s performance is not biased by the specific train-test split.\n","\n","2. Evaluation Metrics: In addition to accuracy, consider using other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of your model&#x27;s performance, especially if the dataset is imbalanced.\n","\n","3. Model Interpretability: Consider using models that provide interpretability, such as decision trees or logistic regression. This can help you understand the factors that contribute to the popularity of online news and provide insights into the problem.\n","\n","4. Feature Importance: After training your models, analyze the feature importance to identify the most influential features. This can help you understand which aspects of online news are more likely to contribute to its popularity.\n","\n","5. Regularization: Experiment with different regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.\n","\n","6. Model Stacking: Instead of simple weighted voting, you can explore more advanced ensemble techniques like model stacking. In model stacking, the predictions of multiple models are used as input features for a meta-model, which then makes the final prediction. This can potentially improve the performance of your ensemble.\n","\n","Remember to document your approach, experiments, and results thoroughly to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future improvements.
